[![CI](https://github.com/shateq/jumble/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shateq/jumble/actions/workflows/test.yml)

... was an inspiration to create this library.

As a result you can **jumble and cipher** strings in various ways. 

And it is WIP

## Get started
`go get github.com/shateq/jumble`

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/shateq/jumble"
)

fun do() {
	fmt.Println(
		jumble.Jumble("Your long sentence")
	)
}

```
